# joinr/nojlight

A little demo of cooperative work between an embedded
nightlight browser repl and a live-coded clay notebook
all within the Noj bundle.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/joinr/nojlight

## Usage

Run the main nojlight entry point from the cli:

    $ clojure -m nojlight.core

This should start 2 processes:
- Clay will start rendering the notebook in /src/nojlight/notebook.clj on e.g.
  http://localhost:1971/
- nightlight will spin up a browser-base embedded clojure IDE on
  http://localhost:8080/

Clay will open first after it builds, you may have to open a new browser tab
with nightlight's url.

From nightlight, you can navigate through the project file tree to src/nojjlight/notebook.clj
and you will get a live clojure code editor.  Feel free to hack on the notebook then save changes
using the save button.

On save, the notebook will be re-rendered by clay automatically and the browser view updated.
